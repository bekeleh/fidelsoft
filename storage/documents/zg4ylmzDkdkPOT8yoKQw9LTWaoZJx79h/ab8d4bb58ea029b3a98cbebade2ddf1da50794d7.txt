I have a few new ProBook 440 G3, just upgraded from Win 7 Pro 64bit to Windows 10 Pro 64bit that had the same problem. What I did is.

 

1. Download the latest Audio driver from HP site (http://h20564.www2.hp.com/hpsc/swd/public/detail?sp4ts.oid=7834513&swItemId=ob_158042_1&swEnvOid=419... a SP73979.exe file.

2. Extract it to the ProBook and install it.

3. Reboot after the installation.

4. You will still get the error after login again. No worry.

5. Goto this folder C:\Program Files\CONEXANT\SA3\HP-NB-AIO, run setup64.exe.

6. You will be prompted to UPGRADE, go ahead.

7. Then reboot the laptop again.

8. After login, the error is gone. But it is not done yet, you have no sound on the laptop.

9. Simply goto the taskbar and look for the Speaker icon, click on the Troubleshoot sound problems and the problem will be fixed.

 

Hope this helps, it resovled my problem after I tried many different ways.
